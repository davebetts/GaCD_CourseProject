Course project for Getting and Cleaning data

The objectives and files used are described in Codebook - GaCD - Course Project.txt, along with descriptions of the measurment variables and observation even labels.

Project data is found in CP.zip

run_analysis.R can be used to download the original data from the url , or unzip and then rocess the data within CP.zip

the final output from the R script is found in tidy_data.txt

still need to change the codebook's title to "Codebook.md".  ?look for some markup language?
